Many countries’ accounting standards have also required the inclusion of diversified risk margins in premium liability provisions. Calculating diversified risk margins requires estimates, correlations and variances of the outstanding claims and premium liabilities. This paper shows how the application of a random effects model to claims payments can be used to unify the estimation of outstanding claims provisions and premium liability provisions, including the estimation of correlations between outstanding claims and premium liability. Estimators are proposed for the model parameters. While the model parameters are estimated using aggregated historical data, the model applies to individual claims, because premium liabilities are a subset of each data point in the aggregate data given in claims triangles, and thus an individual claim model is required to obtain the scaling of mean and variance.'], [""Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA'05)"", 'IEEE · Mar 9, 2006', 'We consider the task of recognition of Australian vehicle number plates (also called license plates or registration plates in other countries).

Also, vehicle owners may place the plates inside glass covered frames or use plates made of non-standard materials. These issues compound the complexity of automatic number plate recognition, making existing approaches inadequate. We have developed a system that incorporates a novel combination of image processing and artificial neural network technologies to successfully locate and read Australian vehicle number plates in digital images.', 'Other authors']]"

This frustration has little to do with the underlying assets. Rather, it relates to the sub-optimal access points and governance structures that tend to intermediate institutional investors from the assets they are trying to invest in. Put simply, external fund managers enjoy a disproportionate amount of power relative to the value they actually add in these illiquid markets. This paper thus argues that investors may want to re-intermediate their investments in alternative asset classes and work with more aligned, external agents. Drawing upon contract theory, we propose a shift towards the relational contracting method based upon trust, mutual dependency, transparency and co-operation as a more aligned governance mechanism for the long-term. Such a method of governance can be achieved through bilateral arrangements such as co-investment agreements, funds-of-one, or managed accounts. In cases where pooled vehicles, such as the Limited Partnership ‘Fund’ model, are more appropriate (and relational contracting is difficult to implement), more emphasis should be placed on fee transparency and on negotiating robust termination clauses in order to incentivize managers and reduce the power asymmetry between the two parties. Structural barriers to the implementation of relational contracts for investment management are identified and relate to the ‘LP’, ‘GP’ legal short hands used in the industry, which consolidates the power of managers as well as the role of investment consultants as gatekeepers to investment managers.', 'Other authors'], ['The Contested Role of Investment Consultants: Ambiguity, Contract, and Innovation in Financial Institutions', 'Jun 1, 2015', 'The global financial crisis and its aftermath put into sharp relief the structure and performance of the global financial services industry. Questions have been raised as to what intermediaries individually and collectively add to the production of investment returns and social welfare in general. In this paper, we look at the roles and responsibilities of investment consultants in relation to asset owners of various types, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and family offices. Focusing upon the relationship between investment consultants and clients, it is suggested that this relationship is characterised by ambiguity; there is a lack of clarity as to the precise roles and responsibilities of both parties. This argument is developed by reference to a set of three prototypical pension funds, distinguished by asset size — a proxy for capabilities and resources. It is argued that ambiguity can be of benefit to both parties. But ambiguity can impose costs upon clients, unable or unwilling to remake their relationships with intermediaries. Our paper highlights instances of innovation, and the ways in which these relationships have been redrawn so as to respond to the challenges of operating in global financial markets.', 'Other authors'], ['Financializing development: toward a sympathetic critique of sovereign development funds', 'Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment · Nov 17, 2014', 'In this paper, we unpack the scope and possibilities of sovereign development funds (SDFs) in different forms and under different political-cum-institutional conditions as a policy tool supporting economic growth and development, particularly in developing countries. Defining what the purpose should be and what is possible is complicated by a number of factors. The form of government of the sovereign sponsor and the significance of public legitimacy may help or hinder different types of investment mandates. Moreover, different investment mandates and their relative sophistication require organizational capabilities and expertise that are often not available locally or are insufficiently developed, such that the implementation of certain investment mandates is constrained and/or too costly. The purpose and the design possibilities of a SDF are, ultimately, contingent on local conditions, resources, and the essential developmental needs of the country and its population.', 'Other authors'], ['English', 'Native or bilingual proficiency'], ['French', 'Full professional proficiency']]"

It means you can deal cost-effectively and compliantly with cross-jurisdictional legislation and regulations. No matter how complex they are. No matter how frequently they evolve.Regulatory Maturity is driven by a new approach to an abundant resource: data. In many instances, non-compliance results from failure to gather the right data, in the right ways, at the right time. Excellent, timely data handling is the heart of achieving and sustaining compliance. But it demands a big data culture shift: from ‘store now, analyze later’ to ‘gather, integrate, analyze and interpret’ - all in real time. The good news is there’s a Regulatory Maturity Model ready to help you make a transformative difference. With Regulatory Maturity achieved, here are the benefits you can expect:- Consistently implemented compliance strategy.- Staying ahead of the compliance curve.- Centralized efficiencies.- Future proofing.- Financial and reputational strength.NOW MOVE FROM ‘INEVITABLE’ FINES TO ASSURED REGULATORY MATURITY.This move is highly desirable.

From nation-states trying to sway elections with fake news to ransomware that shuts down hospitals, we are living in a ""Wild West"" in which seemingly any data, or any transaction, may be compromised if interested parties devote enough resources to the attack. And like travelers in a lawless frontier, we are left to scan the horizon constantly for trouble, scrambling to plug the leaks in defences we cannot trust completely.The objective of this paper is to describe a mechanism for protecting DIDs using existing ciphers for signing during the transition phase to a fully quantum-secure decentralised identity infrastructure. This mechanism is designed to support DIDs but its core mechanisms are identifier-independent and DID:method-independent. Analysis of secure key-management solutions for multiple keys and quantum-resistant ciphers for signing are beyond the scope of this paper and assumed to progress in parallel.

Early industrial standards were primarily driven by European countries including Germany when decades ago DIN Standards were adopted globally. Today standards for the internet — as we know it — are dominated by the North American standard setting ecosystem. Building on ‘Made in China 2025’ (MIC 2025), Beijing is now stepping up its efforts to define the standards for the 4th Industrial Revolution with a 15 years strategic economic development program: China Standards 2035. China’s Standardization Administration describes it neatly: “First-class companies do standards. Second-tier companies do technology. Third-tier companies do products.” Standards allow a company or an ecosystem to control technologies and products — in an enduring, monopolistic manner. Such a uni-polar, monopolistic platform must be avoided to eliminate the risk of unfair exploitation of platform participants by one or two dominating geopolitical powers.By following W3C DID/VC standards for a meta-platform approach, any two Sino-Western business partners that rely on their respective Chinese or Western infrastructures have the tooling to establish trust across their cross-border business processes and their cloud-based infrastructures.On such a platform all materials and products will have a digital twin data supply chain to establish verifiable information to provide and end-to-end provenance tooling for origin, quality, safety, ethics, and environmental transparency of supply chain transactions and trade items.'], ['KERI: A more Performant Ledger for Trusted Identities', 'Medium · Jul 2, 2020', 'One of the fundamental problems of blockchain-based business models is that there are inescapable technical complexities at the root of every business decision.

The new role required someone with a multi-dimensional skill set, spanning deep cybersecurity domain expertise, sophisticated writing skills, public relations, marketing, and social media marketing. I determined that I needed to find the rare person who was simultaneously a driven self-learner, comfortable with multiple disciplines, and possessed an extraordinary work ethic. Two months after starting his new position Daniel single handedly put Check Point on-par with other cybersecurity companies that invested years establishing thought leadership practices. Within 18 months, Check Point surpassed all our competitors, as Daniel published more than 116 blogs on cybersecurity threat research, and led more than 30 complex marketing campaigns that generated thousands of articles in the press, and ultimately influenced millions of readers, industry experts, and customers.  Daniel’s work demonstrated to Check Point’s executive team how thought leadership content and the campaigns to market them could directly contribute to the company’s bottom line. To accomplish these unparalleled results, Daniel needed to learn -- mostly by himself --  complex technical topics, marketing skills, and journalistic writing in English. In addition, he worked directly with multiple teams throughout the company, and because Daniel is extremely relational, he was able to gain their trust and manage multiple time sensitive campaigns with these constituencies. Daniel is always excited by new challenges and is clearly one of the hardest workers I’ve ever met.

A Bayesian Model Averaging Analysis', 'SSRN · Sep 25, 2021', 'This paper analyzes the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BoE) both before and after the global financial crisis. In contrast to extant literature, we use a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach that does not rely on one underlying empirical model but accounts for model uncertainty around the selection of the empirical model. Accounting for heterogeneity in the monetary policy bodies of these central banks, we estimate approximately 33,000 different empirical models for the Fed and 4,000 for the BoE and derive, in the end, one aggregated reaction function for each central bank. Our results suggest the following: First, both central banks appear to consider more than one model when setting interest rates. Second, while the Fed seems to mainly focus on inflation and, most of the time, economic activity, the BoE seems to focus only on economic activity. Third, applying BMA provides valuable additional explanatory power for the interest rate setting of the Fed by accounting for additional models. However, for the BoE, using a BMA approach does not provide substantial benefits compared to conventional empirical techniques.', 'Other authors'], ['A Model for Central Bank Digital Currencies: Implications for Bank Funding and Monetary Policy', 'SSRN · Aug 30, 2021', 'We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to study the impact of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on the financial sector. We focus on the effects of interest- and non- interest-bearing CBDCs during financial crises and their interactions with the effective lower bound. In addition, we analyze the role of central bank funding and a rule-based variable interest rate on CBDCs. We find that CBDCs crowd out bank deposits. However, this crowding out effect can be mitigated if the central bank chooses to provide additional central bank funds or disincentivize large-scale CBDC accumulation through low CBDC interest rates.', 'Other authors'], ['Designing a Central Bank Digital Currency with Support for Cash-Like Privacy', 'SSRN · Jul 21, 2021', 'Most central banks in advanced economies consider issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to address the declining use of cash and to position themselves against increased competition from Big Tech companies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins. One crucial design dimension of a CBDC system is the degree of transaction privacy. Existing solutions are either prone to security concerns or do not provide full (cash-like) privacy. Moreover, it is often argued that a fully private payment system and, in particular, anonymous transactions cannot comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulation. In this paper, we follow a design science research approach (DSR) to develop and evaluate a holistic software-based CBDC system that supports fully private transactions and addresses regulatory constraints. To this end, we employ zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to impose limits on fully private payments. Thereby, we are able to address regulatory constraints without disclosing any transaction details to third parties. We evaluate our artifact in interviews with leading economic, legal, and technical experts and find that a regulatorily compliant CBDC system that supports full (cash-like) privacy is feasible.', 'Other authors'], ['Advanced Econometrics', 'Associated with University of Bayreuth'], ['Advanced Macroeconomics (Top 5)', 'Associated with University of Bayreuth'], ['Blockchain in Business Research', 'Associated with University of Bayreuth'], ['MLP Förderpreis', 'Issued by Universität Bayreuth und MLP · Jul 2019', 'Associated with University of Bayreuth', 'Further information, see here: https://www.bankrecht.uni-bayreuth.de/de/mlp-foerderpreis/index.html'], ['Deutschlandstipendium', 'Jan 2019', 'Associated with University of Bayreuth'], ['McKinsey Firsthand Scholar', 'Issued by McKinsey · Jan 2019', 'Associated with University of Bayreuth']]"

For the temperature range 280 K < T < 370 K, the total mean-squared displacement 〈u2〉 is recorded. Below and above the denaturing, we observe that 〈u2〉 increases monotonically with T, but at the denaturing transition it decreases strongly. This observation can be rationalized and quantitatively modeled as a transition from a liquid protein solution to a gel-like state. Atomic vibrations, molecular subunit diffusion and, most importantly, diffusion of the entire protein determine 〈u2〉. The latter is strongly hindered due to entanglement and cross-linking of the chains and causes the pronounced decrease of 〈u2〉. Using information from the full quasi-elastic signal, we separate the diffusion contribution from 〈u2〉 and reveal the transition temperature. For the analysis of this separation, we introduce a general concept, which is applicable to other colloid systems exhibiting both center-of-mass and internal dynamics.', 'Other authors'], ['Protein Self-Diffusion in Crowded Solutions', 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) · Jun 9, 2011', 'Macromolecular crowding in biological media is an essential factor for cellular function.

Using quasielastic neutron backscattering, we probe the protein self-diffusion in crowded aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin on nanosecond time and nanometer length scales employing the same protein as crowding agent. The measured diffusion coefficient D(φ) strongly decreases with increasing protein volume fraction φ explored within 7% ≤ φ ≤ 30%. With an ellipsoidal protein model and an analytical framework involving colloid diffusion theory, we separate the rotational Dr(φ) and translational Dt(φ) contributions to D(φ). The resulting Dt(φ) is described by short-time self-diffusion of effective spheres.

In addition, for each successful student their mentor will receive $400, and their school will receive a $100 technology grant.As of 2020, Paid for Grades has helped over 800 students and awarded over $1 million to participants and their schools.

This is because the 2014 SI explores some of the turbulence in oil and gas markets while this SI explores the effects of energy (or oil) on macro-economic growth.This issue is timely, in view of the effects of the Great Recession and the tremendous volatility of the oil market in the past year, and the number of questions that have emerged, both as to causes and consequences. There are eight papers in this collection, five of which deal with oil prices and oil shocks, while three focus on the role of energy on economic growth, with emphasis on the cost share and the evidence that the output elasticity of energy appears to be larger than its cost share. Several of the papers report econometric results that are in conflict with the predictions of neo-classical (Solovian) economic growth models. Those models explain growth as a consequence of capital (and labor) accumulation and exogenous improvements in technology, or total factor productivity.', 'Other authors'], ['The economic growth enigma revisited: The EU-15 since the 1970s', 'Energy Policy/Elsevier · May 8, 2015', 'Current macro-econometric models mostly incorporate just two factors of production, labour and capital (with a time-dependent multiplier representing technological change or total factor productivity). These models assume that energy is an intermediate product of some combination of human labour and capital. These models also assume that the supply of energy is driven by economic demand. We assume the contrary, i.e. that useful energy is a primary input, derived (mostly) from natural capital. This failure to capture the impact of primary resources (as useful energy) on economic growth leads to inappropriate formulation of economic growth theories. To understand that impact better we need explicit evidence of marginal products of capital, labour and useful energy or useful work. As applied to the explanation of the past half century of economic growth of the EU-15 countries, the new results demonstrate the use of non-parametric relationships between capital, labour and useful energy to explain economic growth. They also indicate that marginal products of capital, labour and useful energy are variable – the marginal product depends on the levels of capital stock, labour input and useful energy flows. The proposed semi-parametric production function suggests country-specific policy implications for the EU (and other countries).', 'Other authors'], ['English'], ['Greek'], ['Institute of Directors', 'Member · Nov 2013 - Present', 'Associated with ABM Analytics'], ['Chatham House', 'Member · Oct 2013 - Present', 'Associated with ESCP Europe'], ['Royal Geographical Society', 'Fellow · Jan 2006 - Present']]"

Several research articles have concluded that adding commodities to the classical portfolio construction, which usually consists of 60% of equities and 40% of bonds, helps to diversify portfolio risk while protecting investors against inflation-driven asset value erosions. The goal of the present research is to dig deeper into the structure of commodity markets and understand its evolution over time. The present paper will analyze liquid and exchange-traded (ICE and CME) commodity futures prices from three different sectors ranging from January 2010 to August 2019: energy (which can be further sub-divided into crude grades and petroleum products), agricultural, and metals (which can be further sub-divided into precious and base metals.)'], ['Volatility in Crude Oil Markets: Trading and Risk Management', 'J.P.

The implementation of efficient energy hedging strategies has often made the difference between business success and bankruptcy. An indispensable element of hedging is the estimation of volatility. This article explains how a study of volatility fluctuations can be used to build efficient hedging strategies and to understand market sentiment. The key features of this analysis focus on volatility asymmetry and volatility’s mean-reversion propensity. The article finds a negative link between implied volatility, extracted from average price options, and swap prices in both the Brent and WTI markets, implying an asymmetric volatility response to changes in the underlying price. The mean-reversion propensity of volatility is also found to be rather strong in both crude grades under examination.'], ['English', 'Full professional proficiency'], ['Italian', 'Native or bilingual proficiency'], ['Spanish', 'Professional working proficiency']]"

It begins with interpolation of weather variables which come in an hours granularity to 15 minutes and looking for load patterns on week days, weekends, public holidays, seasonality and micro trends in minutes intervals, you can imagine the complexities involved. Trupti rose to the occasion and her mettle shone! Trupti is a never say die person. She has an innate strength and quiet confidence about her. To her the domain of a problem doesn't matter! She puts her heart and soul into solutioning and delivery. Her clients were delighted with her! Though we have left IBM for other opportunities, I do hope, our paths will cross again and we will rake our brains and solve a high value business problem!I wish her all success and hope that she makes a mark as an analytics leader! She will be an asset, wherever she goes.""], ['Sandeep Jain', '· 3rd', 'Leader- Global Materials Management & Data Science at Hewlett Packard Enterprise', ""April 8, 2021, Trupti was senior to Sandeep but didn't manage Sandeep directly"", 'I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with Sandeep.

Many machine learning methods, such as the neural network, the classification tree, and recently the support vector machine, have enjoyed remarkable empirical success and have attracted a lot of interest. As we know the statistical methods often tackle the classification problem through density estimation or regression. Theoretical properties of these statistical methods can be established, but only under the assumption of a fixed order of smoothness. Whether these methods work well when the assumptions are violated is not clear. For this reason one may look for other classification techniques which do not have any such assumptions.The support vector machine (SVM) methodology is a rapidly growing area in machine learning, and is receiving considerable attention in recent years from statistics community as well. Boser, Guyon and Vapnik first proposed it in 1992. SVMs are motivated by the geometric interpretation of maximizing the margin, and are characterized by the use of reproducing kernel. The SVM is best developed in the binary classification situation, even though there are several studies for application of SVM to classifying multiple classes. One way to derive classification rules in practice is to implement the Bayes rule approximately by estimating an appropriate classification function. SVMs are a type of large margin classifier and it can be shown that  SVMs implement the Bayes rule approximately by targeting at some interesting classification functions. This helps us to understand the success of SVMs in many  classification studies and makes it easier to compare SVMs with traditional statistical methods.We have applied the classical techniques for classification (LDA and QDA) and the SVMs to various datasets and tried to draw conclusions that are potentially helpful to practicing statisticians.', 'Other creators']]"

Yet international students, and especially postgraduate students, have the capacity to make major contributions to Australian society. On this basis, CAPA’s recommendations are as follows:Recommendation 1: Reduce job seeking inequalities between temporary visa holders (student visa) and permanent migrants by enforcing Federal discrimination laws:A) Offer additional services, information, and support for international students to understand the discrimination laws of Australia.B) Enforce penalties for employers that openly discriminate against employing recently graduated international students on a temporary visa.Recommendation 2: Launch an inquiry into international student exploitation across Australia, including the underpayment and non-payment of international student employees.

The campaign includes the joint effort of all campus-based student associations in New South Wales:Newcastle University Postgraduate Students AssociationNewcastle University Students’ AssociationSouthern Cross Postgraduate AssociationStudents’ Representative Council, University of SydneySydney University Postgraduate Representative AssociationUniversity of New South Wales Postgraduate CouncilUniversity of New South Wales Student Representative CouncilUniversity of Technology Sydney Students AssociationUniversity of Western Sydney Student Representative CouncilUniversity of Wollongong Undergraduate Students’ AssociationWollongong University Postgraduate Association', 'Other authors'], ['7NEWS Young Achiever Award (Nomination)', 'Issued by 7NEWS · Jan 2022'], ['Youngest Community Achiever of the Year Award (Nomination)', 'Issued by India Australia Business & Community Awards · Dec 2020', 'Associated with Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations'], ['Featured on Monash Alumni Page', 'Issued by Monash University · Aug 2020'], ['English', 'Native or bilingual proficiency'], ['French', 'Elementary proficiency'], ['Hindi', 'Native or bilingual proficiency'], ['International English Language Testing System (IELTS)', 'Score: 7.0 · Dec 2016']]"

However, there is a challenge in valuing OTC contracts. Unlike the FX and interest rate markets where there is plenty of market price data available on the underlying assets, there is much less data available for commodities. As a result, the commodities market is more opaque than the others. In addition, commodity markets are more complex. Unlike, FX and interest rates, commodity markets vary by several factors like grade, location, etc.This leads to a lack of transparency in the market, and presents companies with a problem in understanding the true value of their OTC contracts, and hence their true price exposure.

We show that adaptive tolerance leads to a polarization in tolerance levels, with distinct modes at either extreme of the distribution. Moreover, agents self-organize into communities of like-tolerance, just as they congregate with those of same colour.

Cubic Splines Interpolation. In diverse fields such as computer graphics, pricing of financial derivatives, automobile design, it is often required to interpolate between a set of observed data points. To price an off-market instrument, you must interpolate between key liquid quoted maturities.I put together the intuition, the math behind cubic splines and a python code snippet implementing the algorithm in this notebook.https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantophile/IPython_notebooks/blob/master/Simple%20interpolation%20using%20cubic%20splines%20in%20Python.ipynb#Simple-interpolation-using-cubic-splines-in-Python2. The Vanna-Volga method for FX Implied volatility smile. In FX options markets, there are in general three volatility quotes available for a given market maturity: the delta-neutral straddle, the risk reversal for 25 delta call and put, and the butterfly with 25 delta wings. The application of Vanna-Volga pricing method allows us to use the three market quotes to rebuild the whole implied volatility surface, in particular for those far in-the-money and out-of-the-money strikes.This document summarizes the option greeks Vega, Volga and Vanna and then the Vanna-Volga method.

The estimation step takes the form of a Kalman filter. The control step derives the optimal investment policy in closed form and establishes that the value function is the unique classical solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation. We show that the optimal investment policy generates a continuum of investment strategies, from passive benchmark replication to fully active bets in the Kelly portfolio. However, our model warns against over-betting on financial markets. Moreover, we find that the Kelly portfolio performs both security selection and factor tilt. A simulation study with market data confirms that factor choice is critical at every stage of the investment process. Finally, debiasing is equally crucial. Portfolios with debiased expert forecasts outperform portfolios with biased forecasts.', 'Other authors'], ['Debiased expert forecasts in continuous-time asset allocation', 'Journal of Banking & Finance · Apr 28, 2020', 'Expert forecasts are an essential component of asset management and an important research topic.

We find that biases have a significant impact on portfolios, explaining nearly 70% of excess risk-taking in our implementation. To address the effect of behavioral biases, we propose an integrated behavioral continuous-time portfolio selection model which we solve in closed form. The model applies general principles to identify and reduce the impact of five main behavioral biases.

We investigate whether this ratio is a statistically significant predictor of equity market corrections and rallies. We find that Buffett's decision rule does not deliver satisfactory forecasts. However, when we adopt a time-varying decision rule, the ratio becomes a statistically significant predictor of equity market corrections. The two time-varying decision rules are: (i) predict an equity market correction when the ratio exceeds a 95% one-tail confidence interval based on a normal distribution, and (ii) predict an equity market correction when the ratio exceeds a threshold computed using Cantelli's inequality. These new decision rules are robust to changes in the two key parameters: the confidence level and the forecasting horizon. This paper also shows that the MV/GNP ratio performs relatively well against the four most popular equity market correction models, but the ratio is not a particularly useful predictor of equity market rallies.""], ['CQF Institute', 'Member of the Steering Group · Jan 2014 - Present']]"

The production process includes the following stages: carbon-neutral renewable electricity generation for powering the plant, algal growth in photobioreactors, algae dewatering and lipid extraction, and biofuel conversion and refining. As carbon dioxide is consumed in the algal growth process, side products are not burned (with CO2 release), and the energy supplied to the entire production process is obtained from concentrated solar power, the whole system is assumed carbon footprint negative. Under assumptions related to economics of scale, the techno-economic model is extended to account for varying industrial scales of production. Verified data from a selection of commercially available technologies are used as inputs for the model, and the economic viability of the various production routes is assessed. From the various routes investigated, one scheme involving combined gasification and Fischer-Tropsch of algal solids to produce biodiesel along with conversion of algal lipids into biodiesel through transesterification was found to be promising. Assuming a typical economic scaling factor of 0.8, an algal biodiesel process with an annual production rate of 100 Mt/year is identified to achieve a biodiesel price comparable to the current conventional diesel price with a discounted break-even time of 6 years.', 'Other authors'], ['Bioprocess Modelling of Biohydrogen Production by Rhodopseudomonas palustris: Model Development and Effects of Operating Conditions on Hydrogen Yield and Glycerol Conversion Efficiency', 'Chemical Engineering Science', 'Accepted by CES in Feb 2015', 'Other authors'], ['Hydrogen from Sunlight', 'Aug 2014 - Present', 'Associated with University of Cambridge', 'Diminishing fossil fuel reserves, climbing energy demand, and growing environmental concerns have increased the emphasis on clean renewable energy.

We model a numéraire process and multiplicative spreads between Libor rates and simply compounded overnight indexed swap rates as functions of an underlying affine process. Besides allowing for ordered spreads and an exact fit to the initially observed term structures, this general framework leads to tractable valuation formulas for caplets and swaptions and embeds all existing multicurve affine models. The proposed approach also gives rise to new developments, such as a short rate type model driven by a Wishart process, for which we derive a closed‐form pricing formula for caplets.

However if everybody deleverages at the same time, the consequences are not very difficult to gauge. We are truly in a downward spiral, and coordinated monetary easing is not resulting in money going into the real economy because no one wants to borrow since each and everyone is already deleveraging(liquidity trap at the lower bound of interest rates is contributing in this pessimism here as well). Banking assets that have turned bad must be quarantined into a Bad Bank that is placed directly under the respective Banking supervisor. It is important that there is a clear demarcation of bad assets into the single ""Bad Bank"" which will have separate recovery targets and capitalization. The rest of the ""good banks"" could only then function better with better credit targeting and allocation without the haunting fear of the ghosts of the past which irrationally constrains credit even to deserving candidates.In an era where every private entity is deleveraging, the State cannot also simultaneously deleverage. To rationalize take a simple case: In a closed economy, where there are only two agents, you and me, my spending is your earning and your spending is my earning. The entire world is a closed economy.
